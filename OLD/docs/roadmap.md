# Roadmap

Our vision for Open Source Guides is to provide a jumping off point for individuals, communities, and companies to sustainably embrace open source.

### Q1 2017

We started by focusing on open source creators, because they play a critical role in growing healthy projects. Creators help set good examples for contributors and consumers of open source. We also noticed there were very few comprehensive resources aimed at helping creators.

* [x] Create a first set of guides that help creators start and grow their own open source project
* [x] Make the guides public and release it as an open source project
* [x] Expand [Contributing to Open Source on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/) to include community best practices for contributors, and move it to Open Source Guides
* [ ] Foster healthy community dynamics so the guides become a place to codify community best practices

### Q2 2017

We'll improve upon existing content and start to focus on additional content for open source consumers and contributors.

* [ ] Continue to improve the content for open source creators
* [ ] Improve guide discoverability for open source creators
* [ ] Expand the Open Source Guides to include content for open source consumers

This is our current plan. As with everything in the Open Source Guides project, it is open to community feedback.
